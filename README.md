# TDD Exercise
## How to run
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into directory.
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. `npm test` to run tests.

## Workflow
To get the most out of this exercise you should follow the tdd-cycle:
1. Write a failing test.
2. Write code to pass the test.
3. Refactor code if needed, then goto 1.

Write one test at a time and make sure your code passes that test before continuing to the next one. Try to write just enough code to pass the test case, do not plan for future test cases.

Before every test is run a new account will be created with the initial balance of 1000, so the order in which the tests are run should not matter.

## Solution
Try not to look at it until you're done but an example solution is available if you checkout the `solution` branch.
